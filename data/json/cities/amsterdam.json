Found within the province of North Holland, Amsterdam is colloquially referred to as the \"Venice of the North\", attributed by the large number of canals which form a UNESCO World Heritage Site. |  | Amsterdam's name derives from Amstelredamme, indicative of the city's origin around a dam in the river Amstel. Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world in the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century and became the leading centre for finance and trade. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded, and many new neighbourhoods and suburbs were planned and built."

It was installed there in 1956 and the Remembrance of the Dead ceremony is held there every year.  |  | There are also several important buildings that are worth noticing located by the square – the 15th century Nieuwe Kerk (New Church), the imposing Royal Palace or the popular Madame Tussauds Wax Museum."

The park is named after Samuel Sarphati.In 1942, the park was renamed \"Bollandpark\" after G.J.P.J. Bolland, because Samuel Sarphati was a Jew. The old name was restored after the war in 1945.The Dutch painter Mommie Schwarz and his wife Else Berg lived adjacent to the park from 1927 until their deportation to, and execution at, the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942.  Some of their last works were landscape paintings of the park."
